So when you build a campfire, you're also being a good friend to the forest.",

Camping is about comfort and relaxation. It’s about singing songs around a campfire, cooking up a storm on your portable grill, and maybe even fishing in a nearby lake. Backpacking, meanwhile, is more about the journey than the destination. It's about conquering miles of trail, climbing up mountain paths, wading through streams, and observing wildlife from a respectful distance.

On the other hand, every piece of equipment in backpacking is designed for efficiency and minimal weight. Your tent will likely be a compact, one-person setup, and your sleeping bag will be as lightweight as they come. Cooking gear will probably consist of a small stove and a single pot.

To start a fire, you'll need three basic elements: a fire starter like matches or a lighter, tinder such as dry leaves or paper, and fuel like wood or charcoal. The first step is to build a fire bed, usually a small pit surrounded by rocks. Place your tinder in the center, light it, and then carefully add kindling and larger wood pieces to sustain the fire.
